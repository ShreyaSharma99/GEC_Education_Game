## Pip Install

The easiest way to install ERRANT and its dependencies is using `pip`. We also recommend installing it in a clean virtual environment (e.g. with `venv`). ERRANT only supports Python >= 3.3.
```
python3 -m venv errant_env
source errant_env/bin/activate
pip3 install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip3 install errant
python3 -m spacy download en
```
```
pip3 install gym
```
